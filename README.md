# minisite-bookmarks
EXPERIMENTAL

## Story
I'm doing a switch from 2 frequently used computers (personal and work) to a new, unique one.
On the way, transferring and merging my bookmarks is a headache ! I'm also using several browsers at once, and even when using cool backup/restore, I can't easily sync, merge and transfer my bookmarks. Also, the UI experience of the bookmarks is not the same.

Solution: I'll put my bookmarks in a markdown file in a GitHub repo, and build a GitHub pages hosted minisite to spice up their display !


## Install
1. (optional) create a dedicated GitHub organisations
2. Fork this repo
3. activate github-pages for the new repo


## Usage
Edit the files in the "content" folder (should be trivial)


## Troubleshooting
